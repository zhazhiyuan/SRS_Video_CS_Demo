This demo is using to the proposed SRS algorithm for video CS reconstruction.

When you use this demo, you need to do the following steps:



1. Please load the video sequences; we have been tested 14 standard CIF video sequences, 

if you are requiring, please download them from the following linking:

2. You need to generate the initialization results for key-frames and non-key frames using the proposed intraframe EIC algorithm:

You can directly run the file "EIC_Video_CS_Initalization.m" of the "EIC_Video_CS_Initial_Demo" folder.

We have shared the initialization CS reconstruction results of 14 standard CIF video sequences by the proposed intraframe EIC algorithm in the following link:

3. Finally, when you want to obtain the video CS reconstruction results using the proposed SRS algorithm, you need to do the following operator:

You can directly run the file "SRS_Video_CS_Test_Demo.m" of the "SRS_VCS_Test_Demo" folder.

We have shared the final CS reconstruction results of 14 standard CIF video sequences by the proposed intreframe SRS algorithm in the following link:
